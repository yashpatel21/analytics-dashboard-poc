Introduction
</h3>

<br>

This demo showcases an analytics dashboard that keeps track of the number of visitors that visit the [landing page](https://analytics-dashboard-coral.vercel.app/), along with the country they come from. This allows us to assess the trends in traffic to our site, and also allows further visualizations such as the top countries that contributed to the most traffic.

<br>

The [contact us](https://analytics-dashboard-coral.vercel.app/contact) page is a demo contact page that tracks how many leads we collect, which is also shown in the dashboard. This app does not currently store any information entered into the contact page, as it is a demo.
